\title{Download, label and create design object for PNAD COVID-19 microdata}
\usage{
get_pnadcovid19(
  year,
  month = NULL,
  vars = NULL,
  interview = NULL,
  labels = T,
  design = T,
  savedir = tempdir()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{The year of the data to be downloaded. Must be a number between 2020 and current year. Vector not accepted.}

\item{month}{The month of the year of the data to be downloaded. Must be number from 1 to 12. Vector not accepted. If \code{NULL}, \code{interview} number must be provided.}

\item{vars}{Character vector of the name of the variables you want to keep for analysys. \code{default} is to keep all variables}

\item{interview}{The interview number of the data to be downloaded. Must be number from 1 to 5. Vector not accepted. Using this option will get annual data. If \code{NULL}, monthly data will be downloaded instead.}

\item{labels}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, categorical variables will presented as factors with labels corresponding to the survey's dictionary. Not available for annual data.}

\item{design}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, \code{get_pnadcovid19} will return a object of class \code{survey.design}. It is strongly recommended to keep this parameter as \code{TRUE} for further analysis. If \code{FALSE}, only the microdata will be returned.}

\item{savedir}{Directory for dowloading data. \code{default} is to use a temporary directory.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{survey.design} with the data from PNADc survey and its sample design or a tibble with the survey design variables and selected variables.
}
\description{
Core function of package. with this function only, the user can download a PNADc microdata from a year or month and get a design object ready to use with \code{survey} package functions.
